# Servo_Rotational_Control
Small servo motor swings a wand back and forth along a controlled angle at a fixed rate.

Project created to automate the control of a flame-tipped wand for flash-point testing of asphaults and asphault-based products.
The idea was to limit human interaction with high-temperature metals and eliminate inhalation of various toxic or semi-toxic fumes.
